          <h2>Revelation - The Age of Reason pt. 2</h2>

          <p>
            What would it take to convince me that there was a
            <b>new revelation</b> from God?
          </p>

          <p>
            My family, when I was young, attended a church where people gave
            what they called "prophetic" messages. Someone would stand up during
            the service and speak a "word from the Lord". Mostly, these were
            general words of encouragement ("'Take courage', says the Lord, 'for
            I am with you in the difficult battle that you are facing!'") or
            general words of warning("'Repent', says the Lord, 'and return to me
            while there is still time, for the end is drawing near!'")
          </p>

          <p>
            It's a bold claim to say that God has revealed to <b>you</b> a
            message for others. Yet most of us simply nodded in agreement at
            these "divine messages". Why? Well, once you get used to such
            messages, it's easy to take them in stride. And the messages, as I
            said, <b>were</b> very general. I never heard one that challenged me
            to do anything specific. Take courage? Of course we wanted that.
            Repent? Sure, no one is perfect. It was easy to accept that maybe
            God had whispered these words to our local "prophets", without
            putting too much stock in their special abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what if a message had been more specific and demanding? "God
            wants you to give away your life's savings and trust him for a
            reward" "'Give up those jobs at Ford', says the Lord, 'for my face
            is set against that company!'" Even committed believers would shake
            their heads at such statements. People don't take such commands as
            divine without more proof than the word of a prophet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that a local prophet said that gravity is a lie, or that
            bypass surgery is the devil's work. Or suppose you heard from a
            friend that a prophet from a church across town said that a great
            earthquake was coming in three days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reading <em>The Age of Reason</em> again recently reminded me that
            much of what people accept as revelation from the Bible is similarly
            attested.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Bible opens with two creation stories - one begins in water
            (Genesis 1) and the other in a desert (Genesis 2-3). The second one
            ends with a story that explains how human life became so difficult.
            Neither story names its author. We don't have any historical
            evidence about who wrote them. Neither claims to be written by God
            or revealed from heaven, nor does the book in which they appear
            (Genesis) which is also anonymous but
            <a
              href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2036%3A31&version=NIV"
              target="_blank"
              >contains signs</a
            >
            that it was compiled much later than the events it describes.
          </p>
          <p>
            No Bible-believer who ran across such literature in another place
            would take it as serious history. Yet many today take the creation
            accounts so seriously (it's revelation after all!), along with the
            flood story starting in Genesis 6 that they are willing to say (and
            impose on everyone) that biology, anthropology, archaeology,
            astronomy, and the other sciences are lying to us because they have
            been captured by Satan (a character who evolves from being a tester
            of the faithful in his few appearances in the Hebrew Bible [as a
            member of God's council!] into the ever-more-powerful master of evil
            starting in the Gospels).
          </p>
          <p>
            So I return to my starting question: What would it take to convince
            us that there was a <b>new revelation</b> from God?

          <h2>The Age of Reason</h2>

          <p>
            Any seeker of reason would do well to read Thomas Paine's
            <em>The Age of Reason</em>, the classic popularization of deism
            which was first published in the United States at the beginning of
            the republic (1797-1807). In a brief and straightforward text, Paine
            lays out his case regarding the Bible (its inspiration, authority,
            and morality), supernatural revelation, the authority of religious
            organizations, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paine wasn't a biblical scholar and his writing contains some
            obvious factual errors (such as when he states that "prophet"
            originally meant "poet" or "musician"). Nevertheless, he provides a
            layperson's overview of the content and history of the Bible that
            has long been understood by scholars but is still nearly unheard of
            by religious zealots who make policy today.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a better world, students at seminaries and Bible colleges would
            study <em>The Age of Reason</em> alongside their survey courses of
            the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. And Sunday School
            superintendents, members of local school boards, and Congress people
            would actually read the whole Bible (many never have) and Paine.
          </p>

              having endeavoured to force upon himself the belief of a system

          <h2>Reason Cafe</h2>
          <p>
            Reason Cafe is a place to think about reason, reasonably - a place
            to elevate reason, critical thinking, and rationality over dogmas of
            every kind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dogma: Authoritative ideas accepted uncritically and (often) on
            insufficient evidence. Dogmas come from many places, including
            religion, politics, community standards, family, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reason: The human ability to weigh evidence and think about what is
            true, what works, etc. Reason is often done best in community with
            people who will challenge each other.
          </p>
          <p>No one is free from dogma.</p>
          <p>Reason isn't everything, nor is it an infallible guide.</p>
          <p>
            But it is the best thing humans have. And it is way better than the
            irrationality in ascendency today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reason Cafe launches today, January 20, 2025 - a date which I fear
            will become known as a dark day for reason. Time will tell.

          What troubles me most about my lovely country is that its children are
          seldom taught that American freedom will vanish, if, when they grow
          up, and in the exercise of their duties as citizens, they insist that
          our courts and policemen and prisons be guided by divine or natural
          law.<br />

          The gods value morals alone; they have paid no compliments to
          intellect, not offered it a single reward. If intellect is welcome
          anywhere in the other world, it is in hell, not heaven.<br />

          I shall tell you a parable about people who do things that they think
          God Almighty wants done. In the meanwhile, you would do well, for
          background on this parable, to read everything you can lay your hands
          on about the Spanish Inquisition. <br />
