          Be aware of this truth that the people on this earth could be joyous,
          if only they would live rationally, and if they would contribute
          mutually to each othersâ€™ welfare.<br />

          Reason Cafe is a place to think about reason, reasonably - a place to
          elevate reason, critical thinking, and rationality over dogmas of
          every kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dogma: Authoritative ideas accepted uncritically and (often) on
          insufficient evidence. Dogmas come from many places, including
          religion, politics, community standards, family, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason: The human ability to weigh evidence and think about what is
          true, what works, etc. Reason is often done best in community with
          people who will challenge each other.
        </p>
        <p>No one is free from dogma.</p>
        <p>Reason isn't everything, nor is it an infallible guide.</p>
        <p>
          But it is the best thing humans have. And it is way better than the
          irrationality in ascendency today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason Cafe launches today, January 20, 2025 - a date which I fear
          will become known as a dark day for reason. Time will tell.

          What troubles me most about my lovely country is that its children are
          seldom taught that American freedom will vanish, if, when they grow
          up, and in the exercise of their duties as citizens, they insist that
          our courts and policemen and prisons be guided by divine or natural
          law.<br />

          The gods value morals alone; they have paid no compliments to
          intellect, not offered it a single reward. If intellect is welcome
          anywhere in the other world, it is in hell, not heaven.<br />
