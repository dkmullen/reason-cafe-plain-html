          Be aware of this truth that the people on this earth could be joyous,
          if only they would live rationally, and if they would contribute
          mutually to each others’ welfare.<br />

        <h2>The Age of Reason</h2>

        <p>
          Any seeker of reason would do well to read Thomas Paine's
          <em>The Age of Reason</em>, the classic popularization of deism which
          was first published in the United States at the beginning of the
          republic (1797-1807). In a brief and straightforward text, Paine lays
          out his case regarding the Bible (its inspiration, authority, and
          morality), supernatural revelation, the authority of religious
          organizations, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paine wasn't a biblical scholar and his writing contains some obvious
          factual errors (such as when he states that "prophet" originally meant
          "poet" or "musician"). Nevertheless, he provides a layperson's
          overview of the content and history of the Bible that has long been
          understood by scholars but is still nearly unheard of by religious
          zealots who make policy today.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a better world, students at seminaries and Bible colleges would
          study <em>The Age of Reason</em> alongside their survey courses of the
          Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. And Sunday School superintendents,
          members of local school boards, and Congress people would actually
          read the whole Bible (many never have) and Paine.

          Reason Cafe is a place to think about reason, reasonably - a place to
          elevate reason, critical thinking, and rationality over dogmas of
          every kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dogma: Authoritative ideas accepted uncritically and (often) on
          insufficient evidence. Dogmas come from many places, including
          religion, politics, community standards, family, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason: The human ability to weigh evidence and think about what is
          true, what works, etc. Reason is often done best in community with
          people who will challenge each other.
        </p>
        <p>No one is free from dogma.</p>
        <p>Reason isn't everything, nor is it an infallible guide.</p>
        <p>
          But it is the best thing humans have. And it is way better than the
          irrationality in ascendency today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason Cafe launches today, January 20, 2025 - a date which I fear
          will become known as a dark day for reason. Time will tell.

          What troubles me most about my lovely country is that its children are
          seldom taught that American freedom will vanish, if, when they grow
          up, and in the exercise of their duties as citizens, they insist that
          our courts and policemen and prisons be guided by divine or natural
          law.<br />
          <em>--Kurt Vonnegut</em>

        <p>
          The gods value morals alone; they have paid no compliments to
          intellect, not offered it a single reward. If intellect is welcome
          anywhere in the other world, it is in hell, not heaven.<br />
          <em>--Mark Twain</em>

          I shall tell you a parable about people who do things that they think
          God Almighty wants done. In the meanwhile, you would do well, for
          background on this parable, to read everything you can lay your hands
          on about the Spanish Inquisition. <br />
